    <h1>Mo's introduction</h1>
    <p>
        Hey, I'm Mo Elsamahi. As you have probably learned by now, I am very laid back.<br>
        I am a big nerd that likes the usual of anime, manga, and video games. I listen to a lot of<br>
        punk and metal music and love bad horror films. I love to sleep and do nothing. This is probably good enough.<br>
        PS: If you dont like the color purple, don't talk to me.
    </p>
